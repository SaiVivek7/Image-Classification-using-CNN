# Cat vs Dog Image classification using CNN
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow's Keras library and trained on a labeled dataset of cat and dog images.
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found here: https://bit.ly/ImgClsKeras. The data consists of labeled images of cats and dogs.
